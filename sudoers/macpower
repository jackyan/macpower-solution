# macpower automation sudoers (template)
# Install via:
#   sudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/macpower
#
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your local macOS username (whoami).
#
# This grants passwordless access to /usr/bin/pmset only.
# This is required for launchd (non-interactive) to apply pmset changes.
#
# Security notes:
# - This allows the user to run ALL pmset subcommands without a password,
#   including pmset schedule shutdown/restart. sudoers cannot restrict
#   pmset to specific subcommands.
# - Ensure you trust this account fully before installing.
# - To revoke, run: sudo rm -f /etc/sudoers.d/macpower

YOUR_USERNAME ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/pmset
